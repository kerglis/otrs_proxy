This gem is a bridge between the OTRS API.
You can use this to connect to the OTRS API in a more RESTful way.
This is still a work in development and only partial functionality has been added.

Items to clean up
 - Finish making tickets/articles/links create/update methods more ActiveRecord like

Partially implemented
  - Tickets API
  - Articles API
  - Links API
  - ITSM ConfigItems API
  

To customize for your use you must have the OTRS json.pl in your OTRS cgi-bin directory.
I also added ITSMConfigItemObjects to this json as it is required for my use.
I will create an OPM package with a custom json.pl to do it the right way (instead of editing existing files directly, causing errors in the admin interface).

You need include this gem in your project and call 

	OtrsConnector.initialize_for_app(host, api_url, user, pass)

The username/password combo should be an existing agent in OTRS.

SIMPLE EXAMPLES:

Articles:

	articles = OtrsConnector::OTRS::Ticket::Article.where(ticket_id)
	article = OtrsConnector::OTRS::Ticket::Article.find(id)
	article = OtrsConnector::OTRS::Ticket::Article.new(params[:article])
	article.save
	article.update_attributes(params[:article])
	article.destroy
